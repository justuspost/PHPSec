# This is an example of a PHP function that can help aggregate security logs. The function takes a single parameter $log_files which is an array of log file paths.
# 
# The function uses a foreach loop to iterate through each log file and reads the content of the file using file() function which returns an array of lines.
# 
# Then it uses another foreach loop to iterate through each line of the log file, where it uses explode() function to split the line into an array of parts. The first two elements of the array are used to form the timestamp, while the remaining elements form the event.
# 
# It then adds the timestamp and event to the $aggregated_logs array which will be returned as the final result.
# 
# It's important to note that this is a basic example, and depending on the format of your log files, you may need to adapt the code accordingly. Also, you may want to consider sorting the resulting logs by timestamp, and/or adding more fields to the output.
# 
# Also, it's highly recommended to use a log management tool or a centralized logging system to avoid the need of aggregating logs manually.
#
#
# Hackers can get valuable information from the errors. Be sure to disable the display of errors by setting this parameter in your php.ini file:
# 
# display_errors=Off
# 
# You can still log PHP errors to a specific file by setting:
# 
# log_errors=On
# 
# error_log=/var/log/httpd/php_scripts_error.log
# 
# It's important to log data that can help you detect and investigate security incidents, such as:
# 
# User authentication events (e.g. login attempts, failed logins, successful logins)
# Network traffic (e.g. IP addresses, ports, protocols)
# File access events (e.g. file creation, deletion, modification)
# System events (e.g. system startup, shutdown, updates)
# Security alerts and notifications (e.g. intrusion detection alerts, antivirus alerts)
#

            $event = $log_parts[2];
            $aggregated_logs[] = array(
                "timestamp" => $timestamp,
